Hi I'm Kyle!
I recieved my degree in robotics where I did a Senior Thesis on simulating Milipede movements with cheap leg actuators (See Projects Below).
For 3 years I worked throughout Googles robotics departments, getting robots to pickup kitchens (see Project Saycan), dance (see Project Starling), and make music (See Project Music Mode).
After leaving Google, I've been working at Stout Industrial Technology, empowering Farmers with plant level data on their fields and improving their yield with our autonomous smart cultivator what uses AI vision to detect weeds in the field.
In my free time I program odds and ends for fun.
